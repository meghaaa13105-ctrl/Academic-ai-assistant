The server responds with its own SYN segment containing its initial sequence number (ISN(y)). This is the segment 2. The server also acknowledges the client’s SYN by ACK’ing ISN(x) plus 1. Note that a SYN consumes one sequence number and is retransmitted if lost. 3. The client acknowledges SYN from the server by ACK’ing ISN(y) plus 1. This is the segment 3. ⚫These three segments complete the connection establishment. ⚫This is often called the three-way handshake. ⚫Its main purposes are to let each end of the connection know that a connection is starting and the special details that may be carried as options, and to exchange the ISNs of both ends.
